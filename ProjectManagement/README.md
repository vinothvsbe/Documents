* Temporary Initiative with Start Date and End Date. Will have strict expiry date.

Change in one part of the Triangle will trigger change in other corners.

For Eg: If you want to pull end date of the project then Cost has to be increased or Scope has to be decreased or do both in certain situations

> Operations are carried away day to day , so ony that will have start date but no end date. Accouunting, Finance, Product, Sales, Marketing are operations.

Here’s the updated, **WYSIWYG-friendly**, colorful version with emojis and structured layout:
